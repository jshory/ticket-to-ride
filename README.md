## Ticket to Ride Calculator

A single-page scoring tool for the board game Ticket to Ride. This project was borne out of a (small) frustration over my inability to track all built routes throughout gameplay, and finding the scoring to be slightly overwhelming at the end of the game. I also set out to style this web app without the use of a CSS library/framework.

### Technology

The Ticket to Ride calculator is built with React (version 16.10.2) and styled with CSS3.

### Status

To be implemented in the future:
* Sort "Scores" panel by score, rather than by Player #
* Allow players to choose to score game based on expansion (i.e., Ticket to Ride Europe, Asia, Nordic Countries, etc.)
* Style transitions between scoring forms
